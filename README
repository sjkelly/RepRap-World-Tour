This is a compilation of all software needed for the RepRap world tour, or any for that matter. Each piece of software is the property of it's respective owner.

How to use:

Use Arduino to upload the sprinter files.
Run Printrun/pronterface.py, and print the 20mm box.
Starting off you should only need to adjust the Filament Packing Density under Dimension in Skeinforge.


Recommended:
If you aren't already, get on the #reprap IRC channel on freenode. The people are very friendly and can help you out.
Keep your software up to date. You can find both Sprinter (firmware) and Printrun (host package) at http://www.github.com/kliment
